Let's break down the rotation equations for the hour, minute, and second hands of an analog clock in a more detailed and beginner-friendly way:

1. **Hour Hand (h):** The hour hand on a clock moves slower than the minute and second hands. It completes one full rotation (360 degrees) in 12 hours. This means that each hour corresponds to a rotation of 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves a little bit further. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each minute adds 0.5 degrees to the hour hand's rotation (30 degrees / 60 minutes).

   So, the total rotation of the hour hand for 'h' hours and 'm' minutes is calculated using this formula:
   Rotation of hour hand = (30 * h) + (m * 0.5) degrees.

   For example, if it's 3:15 (3 hours and 15 minutes):
   Rotation of hour hand = (30 * 3) + (15 * 0.5) = 90 + 7.5 = 97.5 degrees.

2. **Minute Hand (m):** The minute hand moves faster than the hour hand. It completes one full rotation (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. This means that each minute corresponds to a rotation of 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes).

   So, the total rotation of the minute hand for 'm' minutes is calculated using this formula:
   Rotation of minute hand = 6 * m degrees.

   For example, if it's 25 minutes past the hour:
   Rotation of minute hand = 6 * 25 = 150 degrees.

3. **Second Hand (s):** The second hand moves even faster than the minute hand. It completes one full rotation (360 degrees) in 60 seconds. This means that each second corresponds to a rotation of 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 seconds).

   So, the total rotation of the second hand for 's' seconds is calculated using this formula:
   Rotation of second hand = 6 * s degrees.

   For example, if it's 10 seconds past the minute:
   Rotation of second hand = 6 * 10 = 60 degrees.

These equations help us understand how the hands of an analog clock move relative to each other based on the passage of time. The hour hand moves slowly, the minute hand moves faster, and the second hand moves the fastest, each contributing to the overall timekeeping function of the clock.
